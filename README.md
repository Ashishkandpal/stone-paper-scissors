## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

i made this project using react and i used css with module format (module.css). And i resused some components at many places. And for the score i have used local storage for storing the scores. I have also tried to make this work on mobile also. At some places i was stuck like creating those circles which comes after if anyone wins.

### Continued development

I would like to add bonus content also means adding more signs, and a concept of matches like 3 matches or 5 matches.
